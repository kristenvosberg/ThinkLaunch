  <H1><em> String </em>
    <br>
    String data is represented by variables which hold information themselves. Examples include DNA sequencing in Bioinformatics :)
    <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    <H2> <strong> Boolean </strong> </H2>
    <br>
    Boolean data is represented by two different variables only and is meant to represent objective truths rooted in algebreic logic.
    <br>
    Examples include data that relies on True/False outcomes, Present/not present outcomes. Binary maybe? Definitely in biology a Derived Charecter state chart, used to analyze evolution of species, would be considered Boolean data.

    <H3><strong> Integer </strong></H3>
    <br>
    Integer data represents a subset of numerical data. 
    <br>
    Examples include:(help pls)
    <p>
      <p>
        <H4><em>Float</em></H4>
        <br>
        Float data can represent very big numbers. Its useful for applications that need large numbers but do not need precise accuracy
  </p>
  <p>
    <H5><strong>Hash/Object Hash </strong></H5>
    <br>
    Hash acts to map between string fields and string values, so they are the perfect data type to represent objects.
    <br>
    Examples include a user with a number of fields like name, surname, age, and so forth
